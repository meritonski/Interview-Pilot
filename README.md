## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-09

Your privacy matters. Interview Pilot is built to work primarily on-device and does **not** require you to create an account.

### 1. Overview
Interview Pilot is designed to function without collecting personal data. The app stores your information locally on your device and, if you choose to enable it, can sync your information via Apple iCloud (CloudKit). We do not sell, rent, or share your information.

### 2. Information the app stores (on your device)
Interview Pilot may store the following types of information locally on your device, depending on how you use the app:
- Job applications you add (e.g., role title, company name, status, notes)
- Preparation items you create (e.g., tasks, steps, progress)
- Interview information you add (e.g., dates/times, reminders)
- App preferences and settings (e.g., notification toggle)

This data is stored **only** to provide the features of the app.

### 3. Data collection by the developer
Interview Pilot does **not** collect personal data for advertising, profiling, or tracking. We do not run third-party trackers in the app.

If you contact support by email, we will receive the information you choose to send (such as your email address and message contents). We use that information only to respond and provide support.

### 4. iCloud / CloudKit sync (optional)
If you enable iCloud syncing, Interview Pilot uses **Apple iCloud / CloudKit** to synchronize your app data across your devices signed into the same Apple ID.

Important notes:
- iCloud sync is **optional** and controlled by you.
- Your iCloud data is handled under Apple’s privacy and security model.
- The developer does **not** have access to your iCloud account and cannot view your CloudKit private database contents.

### 5. Notifications (optional)
If you enable notifications, Interview Pilot may schedule reminders (for example, for interview dates you have entered).

- Notifications are used solely for reminders you configure in the app.
- Notifications are typically scheduled locally on your device.
- We do not use notifications for marketing or advertising.

You can disable notifications at any time in the app settings or in iOS Settings.

### 6. Third-party services
Interview Pilot does not integrate third-party advertising networks and does not use third-party analytics tools that track you across apps or websites.

If iCloud syncing is enabled, Apple iCloud/CloudKit is used as described above.

### 7. Data sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.

We may disclose information only if required to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. If we ever receive such a request, we will only provide information to the extent legally required.

### 8. Data retention
Your data remains:
- on your device, and
- optionally in your iCloud account (if you enable iCloud)

We do not operate our own servers that store your Interview Pilot content.

Support emails: If you contact support, we may retain support messages for as long as needed to resolve the request and maintain reasonable support records.

### 9. Managing and deleting your data
You control your data.

**Local data**
- You can delete items inside the app.
- Uninstalling the app removes locally stored data from your device.

**iCloud data (if enabled)**
- If you enabled iCloud syncing, your data may also exist in your iCloud account.
- You can manage or remove app data via iOS iCloud storage settings (Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Account Storage), depending on Apple’s available options.

### 10. Security
Interview Pilot stores data locally on your device and relies on iOS security protections. If you enable iCloud, Apple’s iCloud security and encryption mechanisms apply.

No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, but we aim to minimize data exposure by not collecting or storing your content on our own servers.

### 11. Children’s privacy
Interview Pilot is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 12. Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the app or legal requirements. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above.

### 13. Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app’s privacy practices, contact:
